## Description

Our program asks the user for their `name`, as well as the `number of iterations` they would like. Then, for each iteration, it concatenates the name to itself a number of times equal to the current iteration. Lastly, it prints the name to the console.

## Installation

Before running this program you will need to have Python, PIP, and Jupyter Notebook installed.
- For more information on installing [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Usually PIP is installed when installing Python. In any case, check this link out for more information on working with [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- Lastly, ensure you are able to setup and run a [Jupyter Notebook](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/#:~:text=the%20next%20level.-,Getting%20Up%20and%20Running%20With%20Jupyter%20Notebook,purposes%20of%20installing%20Jupyter%20Notebook.)

You can clone this repo and run the `.ipynb` file if you would like to work with or simply use this program.
After setting up [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) you will have to fork this repo and then clone your fork with the git command `git clone https://github.com/brianhutton82/cmpinf0010_lab6.git`

You can also copy the raw contents of the `.ipynb` file and save it with the extension `.py` if you prefer to work with Python and not Jupyter Notebook.

## Miscellany
The reason for choosing the MIT license was that it gives users express permission to reuse the code for any purpose, as long as the users include the original copy of the MIT license in the distribution. It is one of the most simple open source license agreements, and because of its open language, it serves both – the developers who feel GNU GPL licenses are too liberal and those who believe all software should become proprietary – pretty well. Our reasoning for the current Code of Conduct, is that since our code can be openly used for any purpose, we only want to allow it to be used in a positive manner. Any attempt to use the code in a demeaning way, or one that causes harm or discomfort to other people, directly contrasts our intentions, and is strictly prohibitied. We would like to be inclusive of all people and spread positivity rather than hate, and we expect users of our code to follow the same principle.
